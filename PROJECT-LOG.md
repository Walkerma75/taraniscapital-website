## Pending / To Do

### Immediate (commit & deploy)
1. **Remove git lock and commit** — Run from local machine:
   ```
   cd "C:\Users\mark\Claude Cowork\Taranis Capital Website"
   del .git\index.lock
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Site-wide updates: team ordering, address fixes, header cleanup, partners, jurisdiction"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. **Verify live site** — Check all pages load correctly on CloudFront URL after deployment

### RSS Feeds for Insights Page
3. **Implement live RSS feeds** — Current insights page has static placeholder articles. Need to add JavaScript RSS reader or build step. Suggested feeds:
   - **Venture Capital:** TechCrunch VC (techcrunch.com/category/venture/feed/), PitchBook News, EU-Startups
   - **Biotech:** FierceBiotech, BioSpace, Endpoints News, GEN
   - **MENA:** MENA Bytes (menabytes.com/feed/), Wamda, Magnitt, Arabian Business Tech
   - Limit display to 12 most recent articles per category

### Content & Data
4. **Missing board member bios** — 3 board members returned 404 on old site (Osama Al Zamil, Mohammed Aljumah, Rayan Al-Karawi) — bio content needed
5. **Board members without LinkedIn** — Daniel Roubeni, Dr Amer Mahmood, Dr Tarek El Mansy, Ghassan Najmeddin, Osama Al-Thanon
6. **Scrape old WP fund pages** — Additional content from old WP site for enriching fund pages

### Technical
7. **DNS & SSL** — Confirm custom domain and SSL certificate are validated
8. **Sitemap update** — sitemap.xml needs new pages (team/*, board/*, fund pages)
9. **SEO & meta tags** — Review and optimise across all new pages
10. **Mobile responsiveness** — Test all new pages on mobile devices
11. **Analytics** — Consider adding Google Analytics or similar

### Design
12. **Images** — Need to decide on imagery for: company intro section placeholder, fund pages, partner logos (currently text-only cards)
